You are classifying one short human insight to enrich semantic embedding quality.
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "topic_label": "2-6 word topic tag",
  "stance_hint": "pro" | "con" | "neutral",
  "canonical_claim": "short normalized claim"
}

Guidelines:
- topic_label should represent the underlying issue/topic, not sentiment.
- stance_hint should capture directional support/opposition in plain terms.
- canonical_claim should remove style/noise and preserve core meaning.
- Keep labels concise and concrete.
