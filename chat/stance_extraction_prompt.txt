You extract stance for one insight against a cluster's tension axis.
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "canonical_claim": "single concise claim",
  "stance_label": "pro" | "con" | "neutral",
  "counterclaim": "best short opposing claim"
}

Guidance:
- "pro" means supporting the dominant direction in context.
- "con" means pushing against it.
- Prefer "pro" or "con" for opinion claims whenever possible.
- Use "neutral" only when the sentence is truly mixed, ambiguous, or non-committal.
- Counterclaim should be a credible opponent position, not a strawman.
