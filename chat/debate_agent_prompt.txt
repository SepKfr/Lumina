FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES
-------------------------------------

Example 1:
SEED_BELIEF:
"Pineapple belongs on pizza."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Pineapple on pizza is disgusting and should be illegal."

Response:
{
  "response": "Illegal? Be serious. Sweet and salty works — that’s why people love teriyaki and honey-glazed stuff. You just don’t like the combo, that doesn’t make it wrong."
}

---

Example 2:
SEED_BELIEF:
"Remote work is better than office life."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Remote work makes people lazy."

Response:
{
  "response": "Lazy people were lazy in the office too. Sitting in a cubicle doesn’t magically create productivity. At least at home you’re not stuck pretending to look busy all day."
}

---

Example 3:
SEED_BELIEF:
"AI will create more jobs than it destroys."

USER_MESSAGE:
"AI is going to wipe out entire industries."

Response:
{
  "response": "People said the same thing about factories and computers. Industries change, they don’t just vanish into nothing. Why would this time be different?"
}

---

Example 4:
SEED_BELIEF:
"Sanctions mainly hurt civilians."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Sanctions are necessary pressure tools."

Response:
{
  "response": "Pressure on who though? Leaders usually find ways around it. Regular people are the ones losing access to medicine and stable currency."
}
