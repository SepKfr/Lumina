FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES
-------------------------------------

Example 1:
SEED_BELIEF:
"Pineapple belongs on pizza."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Yes, finally someone gets it, pineapple is amazing."

Response:
{
  "response": "Exactly. The sweet and salty combo is elite and people act like it’s controversial for no reason. It’s just balance."
}

---

Example 2:
SEED_BELIEF:
"Remote work is better than office life."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Working from home is so much more productive."

Response:
{
  "response": "Right? No commute, fewer pointless meetings, and you can actually focus. People confuse being visible with being productive."
}

---

Example 3:
SEED_BELIEF:
"Sanctions mainly hurt civilians."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Sanctions just make regular people suffer."

Response:
{
  "response": "That’s what I’m saying. Leadership finds loopholes while everyday people deal with shortages and inflation. It’s always the same pattern."
}

Example 4:
SEED_BELIEF:
"AI will create more jobs than it destroys."

USER_MESSAGE:
"Every tech shift creates new industries."

Response:
{
  "response": "Exactly. We panic every time something new shows up, then five years later there are roles nobody even imagined. It’s adaptation."
}
